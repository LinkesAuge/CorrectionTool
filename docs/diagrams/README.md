# Interface Documentation Diagrams

This directory contains visual diagrams representing the interface architecture of the Chest Tracker Correction Tool.

## Overview

These diagrams provide a comprehensive visual representation of:
- Interface hierarchies and inheritance
- Implementation relationships
- Component interactions
- Workflow sequences
- Dependency injection patterns
- Event system flows

## Diagram Types

### 1. Interface Class Diagrams

Located in the `class/` directory, these diagrams show:
- Interface definitions and hierarchies
- Method signatures
- Inheritance relationships
- Implementation relationships

### 2. Sequence Diagrams

Located in the `sequence/` directory, these diagrams illustrate key workflows:
- File import process
- Validation process
- Correction application process
- UI update sequences

### 3. Component Interaction Diagrams

Located in the `component/` directory, these diagrams show:
- High-level component relationships
- Data flow patterns
- Service dependencies
- Module boundaries

### 4. Dependency Injection Diagrams

Located in the `di/` directory, these diagrams illustrate:
- Service factory patterns
- Dependency resolution flows
- Initialization sequences
- Service registration patterns

### 5. Event System Diagrams

Located in the `events/` directory, these diagrams show:
- Event publishers and subscribers
- Event propagation paths
- Event data structures
- Event handling sequences

## Tools and Maintenance

These diagrams are created using PlantUML, a text-based UML diagram creation tool.

### Viewing Diagrams

1. PNG and SVG versions are provided for quick reference
2. Source `.puml` files are included for editing

### Updating Diagrams

To update a diagram:

1. Edit the corresponding `.puml` file
2. Generate the diagram using PlantUML
3. Replace the existing PNG/SVG files

```bash
# Generate a diagram from a .puml file
java -jar plantuml.jar path/to/diagram.puml
```

### Testing Diagram Accuracy

Diagram accuracy is validated through:
1. Automated tests that compare diagrams to code
2. Manual review during architecture changes
3. Continuous integration checks that flag outdated diagrams

## Usage Guidelines

1. Refer to these diagrams when making architecture changes
2. Update diagrams when modifying interfaces or implementations
3. Add new diagrams when adding new components or workflows
4. Use diagrams for onboarding new developers
5. Reference diagrams in technical documentation
