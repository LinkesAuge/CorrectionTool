# Filter System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing an enhanced filtering system for the Chest Tracker Correction Tool. The new filter system will allow users to efficiently filter entries based on validation lists, support multi-select capabilities, and provide advanced search functionality.

## Objectives

1. Create dropdown filters populated from validation lists
2. Implement multi-select filtering capabilities
3. Add search functionality to filters
4. Ensure filter state persists between application sessions
5. Provide clear visual feedback for active filters

## Success Criteria

- Users can filter entries by player, chest type, and source
- Multiple filter selections are supported for each filter type
- Text search works across all columns or specific columns
- Filter state is saved in the configuration and restored on startup
- Clear visual indicators show which filters are active
- Filter controls are intuitive and easy to use

## Technical Implementation Details

### Filter Manager

The FilterManager will be responsible for:
1. Registering various filter types (validation list, text search)
2. Coordinating filter application order
3. Combining filter results
4. Notifying UI components of filter changes

```python
class FilterManager:
    """
    Manages filter application and coordination across multiple filter types.
    
    Attributes:
        _filters (Dict[str, IFilter]): Dictionary of registered filters by ID
        _data_store (IDataStore): Data store to apply filters on
    """
    
    def __init__(self, data_store: IDataStore):
        """Initialize with a data store."""
        self._filters = {}
        self._data_store = data_store
        
    def register_filter(self, filter_id: str, filter_obj: IFilter) -> None:
        """Register a new filter."""
        self._filters[filter_id] = filter_obj
        
    def apply_filters(self) -> None:
        """Apply all active filters to the data store."""
        # Implementation will chain filters efficiently
        
    def clear_filters(self) -> None:
        """Clear all active filters."""
        
    def save_filter_state(self, config: IConfigManager) -> None:
        """Save filter state to configuration."""
        
    def load_filter_state(self, config: IConfigManager) -> None:
        """Load filter state from configuration."""
```

### Filter Dropdown Component

The FilterDropdown component will provide a UI for selecting filter values:

```python
class FilterDropdown(QWidget):
    """
    Dropdown widget for selecting multiple filter values.
    
    Provides a searchable, multi-select dropdown populated from a validation list.
    """
    
    filter_changed = Signal()  # Emitted when filter selection changes
    
    def __init__(self, filter_id: str, title: str, validation_list: IValidationList):
        """Initialize with filter ID, title and validation list."""
        super().__init__()
        self._filter_id = filter_id
        self._title = title
        self._validation_list = validation_list
        self._selected_items = set()
        self._setup_ui()
        
    def _setup_ui(self) -> None:
        """Set up the UI components."""
        # Implementation will create multi-select dropdown
        
    def get_selected_values(self) -> List[str]:
        """Get currently selected values."""
        return list(self._selected_items)
        
    def set_selected_values(self, values: List[str]) -> None:
        """Set selected values programmatically."""
        
    def clear_selection(self) -> None:
        """Clear all selected values."""
```

### IFilter Interface

```python
class IFilter(ABC):
    """Interface for filter implementations."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def apply(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Apply filter to a DataFrame and return filtered result."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def is_active(self) -> bool:
        """Check if filter is currently active."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def clear(self) -> None:
        """Clear the filter settings."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def save_state(self, config: IConfigManager, section: str) -> None:
        """Save filter state to configuration."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def load_state(self, config: IConfigManager, section: str) -> None:
        """Load filter state from configuration."""
        pass
```

## Configuration Integration

The filter system will store its state in the configuration with the following structure:

```ini
[Filters]
active_filters = player,chest_type,source,text_search

[Filter_Player]
selected_values = Player1,Player2,Player3
logic = OR
enabled = true

[Filter_ChestType]
selected_values = Rare Chest,Epic Chest
logic = OR
enabled = true

[Filter_Source]
selected_values = Level 10,Level 15
logic = OR
enabled = true

[Filter_TextSearch]
search_text = treasure
target_columns = all
case_sensitive = false
whole_word = false
regex_enabled = false
enabled = true
```

## UI Design

The filter system will be integrated into the dashboard sidebar with the following elements:

1. **Filter Section**: Collapsible section in the sidebar
2. **Filter Dropdowns**: One dropdown for each validation list (Players, Chest Types, Sources)
3. **Search Bar**: Text search input with options button
4. **Filter Status**: Visual indicator showing number of active filters
5. **Clear All**: Button to clear all filters

## Signals & Events

The filter system will use the following signals and events:

1. `filter_changed`: Emitted when any filter is modified
2. `filters_cleared`: Emitted when all filters are cleared
3. `filter_preset_loaded`: Emitted when a saved filter preset is loaded
4. `filter_state_saved`: Emitted when filter state is saved to configuration

## Timeline & Dependencies

### Dependencies
- Validation lists must be properly loaded
- DataFrameStore must support efficient filtering
- UI must have space for filter controls in sidebar

### Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: Core Filter Components - 2 days
- Phase 2: UI Integration - 1 day
- Phase 3: Advanced Features - 2 days
- Phase 4: Performance Optimization & Testing - 1 day

Total estimated time: 6 days

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each filter type individually
   - Verify filter combination logic
   - Test edge cases (empty selections, all selected)

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test filter integration with DataFrameStore
   - Verify UI updates properly with filter changes
   - Test filter persistence in configuration

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Measure filtering performance with large datasets
   - Test UI responsiveness during filtering operations

## Rollout Strategy

1. Implement core filter components first
2. Add basic UI integration with minimal styling
3. Test with real data to verify functionality
4. Implement advanced features and optimizations
5. Finalize UI styling and animations
6. Perform thorough testing with various datasets
7. Document usage in user guide

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Risks
1. **Performance Impact**: Filtering large datasets could cause UI lag
   - Mitigation: Implement asynchronous filtering and caching

2. **UI Complexity**: Too many filter options could overwhelm users
   - Mitigation: Design clear, collapsible UI with good visual hierarchy

3. **Filter Combinations**: Complex filter logic could be confusing
   - Mitigation: Provide clear visual feedback on active filters

4. **Memory Usage**: Storing many filter presets could use excessive memory
   - Mitigation: Implement efficient storage and limit number of presets

## Conclusion

The enhanced filter system will significantly improve the usability of the Chest Tracker Correction Tool by allowing users to quickly find and focus on specific entries. The implementation will prioritize performance, usability, and integration with existing components while providing new capabilities for power users.
