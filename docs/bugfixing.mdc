# Bug Fixing Log

## ValidationListWidget Constructor Parameter Error
**Date**: 2024-03-21

**Issue**: The application failed to start due to a TypeError in the `ValidationListWidget.__init__()` method, where the constructor was trying to pass a DataFrame to the parent QWidget's constructor.

**Error**: 
```
TypeError: 'PySide6.QtWidgets.QWidget.__init__' called with wrong argument types:
  PySide6.QtWidgets.QWidget.__init__(DataFrame)
```

**Root Cause**: The constructor of `ValidationListWidget` didn't correctly handle the parameters being passed to it. The class expected parameters in a different order than how they were being called in `correction_manager_interface.py`, which was causing the DataFrame to be incorrectly used as the parent parameter.

**Solution**: Fixed the `ValidationListWidget.__init__` method to properly accept parameters in the order they were being passed: list_type, validation_list, config_manager, and parent, correctly passing only the parent parameter to the parent class constructor.

**Status**: âœ… Fixed and verified.

**Prevention**: When designing widget classes that take multiple parameters, always ensure the constructor parameters are clearly labeled, and maintain a consistent order in both definitions and calls.

## Interface Architecture Issues Identified
**Date Identified**: March 19, 2025

### Issue Description
While testing data display and correction application functionality, several issues were identified in the interface architecture implementation that prevent proper data flow and event handling:

1. **Event Type Inconsistency**: The application has two competing `EventType` enum implementations:
   - One defined in `src/interfaces/events.py`
   - Another defined directly in `src/services/dataframe_store.py`
   
   This causes event subscription mismatches, leading to events not being properly propagated when components use different `EventType` implementations.

2. **Singleton Pattern Conflicts with Dependency Injection**: 
   - Several UI components are using `DataFrameStore.get_instance()` directly instead of using injected dependencies
   - This creates conflicts when testing with the service factory providing a specific data store instance

### Affected Components
- EntryTableAdapter and CorrectionRuleTableAdapter (using `DataFrameStore.get_instance()`)
- Test scripts attempting to use service factory and dependency injection
- Event handlers subscribing with mismatched EventType enums

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Event Type Duplication**: The DataFrameStore module defines its own internal EventType enum, while the interfaces package provides a standardized version. Components using the interfaces version can't successfully subscribe to events from a DataFrameStore that's using its internal version.

2. **Inconsistent Dependency Access**: The application architecture is partially migrated to a dependency injection approach, but some components still use direct singleton access, creating inconsistencies in how dependencies are obtained.

### Diagnosis Tests
Created test script `tests/test_data_display_issue.py` to diagnose the issues, which demonstrated:
- Successful loading of entries and correction rules
- Successful application of corrections
- Failure in event propagation due to EventType mismatches
- Issues with table adapters not using injected DataFrameStore instances

### Planned Fixes
1. **Event System Standardization**:
   - Move EventType to a single location (interfaces/events.py)
   - Remove duplicate EventType from dataframe_store.py
   - Update all imports to use the standardized version

2. **Dependency Injection Refinement**:
   - Refactor DataFrameStore to fully support dependency injection
   - Update all UI adapters to accept injected dependencies
   - Remove singleton pattern from DataFrameStore

## Application Startup Failures Fixed
**Date Fixed**: March 18, 2025

### Issue Description
The application was failing to start properly, with initialization stopping at the `MainWindow` creation stage. The only visible error was related to the `set_correction_rules` method in the Dashboard class.

### Root Cause
Two critical issues were identified:
1. The `Dashboard` class was problematic due to the now-removed `set_correction_rules` method which was still being connected to signals in `MainWindow`
2. Missing initialization attributes in the `CorrectionRulesTable` class, specifically:
   - The `_processing_signal` flag was not initialized in the constructor
   - A variable name mismatch where `_last_update_time` was referenced in the `reset` method but `_last_reset_time` was initialized

### Solution
Implemented the following fixes:

1. Dashboard signal handling:
   - Removed the problematic `set_correction_rules` method from the `Dashboard` class
   - Updated the signal connections in `MainWindow._connect_signals` to directly connect to `self._dashboard.corrections_loaded.emit`
   - Fixed the signal audit connections in `MainWindow._audit_signal_connections` to use the `corrections_loaded` signal directly

2. CorrectionRulesTable fixes:
   - Added proper initialization of the `_processing_signal` flag in the `__init__` method
   - Added initialization of the `_last_reset_time` variable in the constructor
   - Fixed the variable name mismatch in the `reset` method, changing references to `_last_update_time` to `_last_reset_time`

### Implementation Details
The changes included:

1. In `Dashboard` class:
```python
# Removed problematic method:
# def set_correction_rules(self, rules):
#     ...
```

2. In `MainWindow` class:
```python
# Changed from:
# data_manager.correction_rules_changed.connect(self._dashboard.set_correction_rules)
# To:
data_manager.correction_rules_changed.connect(self._dashboard.corrections_loaded.emit)
```

3. In `CorrectionRulesTable` class:
```python
def __init__(self, parent=None) -> None:
    super().__init__(parent)
    
    # Add processing signal flag to prevent signal loops
    self._processing_signal = False
    self._last_reset_time = 0
    
    # Set up the model
    self._model = CorrectionRulesModel(self)
    self.setModel(self._model)
    
    # ... existing code ...
```

4. Fixed the variable name in the reset method:
```python
def reset(self) -> None:
    # ... existing code ...
    current_time = time.time()
    if current_time - self._last_reset_time < 0.1:  # Changed from _last_update_time
        logger.debug("Reset throttled (too frequent), skipping")
        return
    
    try:
        self._processing_signal = True
        self._last_reset_time = current_time  # Changed from _last_update_time
        # ... existing code ...
```

### Lessons Learned
1. Always ensure class attributes are properly initialized in the constructor
2. Be consistent with variable naming across methods
3. When removing methods, check for any signal connections that might reference them
4. When implementing signal loop prevention, make sure all necessary attributes are initialized
5. Enhanced logging with timestamps makes debugging easier
6. Be careful when applying optimizations to existing code - ensure all references are updated

The application is now able to start correctly, load correction rules, and process input data without crashes.

## Signal Loop Prevention in Dashboard Class
**Date Fixed**: [Current Date]

### Issue Description
The application was crashing after importing data without any user input or actions. This was caused by signal loops in the Dashboard class, where signals were being processed recursively without proper guards.

### Root Cause
When data was loaded, multiple signals were triggered in sequence (`entries_loaded`, `corrections_loaded`, `corrections_applied`). These signals could cause cascading effects where one signal handler would trigger another signal, creating infinite loops and eventually causing stack overflow or other crashes.

### Solution
Implemented a signal loop prevention mechanism in the Dashboard class:

1. Added a `_processing_signal` flag to track when a signal is already being processed
2. Modified the key signal handler methods to check this flag and prevent re-entrance:
   - `_on_entries_loaded`
   - `_on_corrections_loaded` 
   - `_on_corrections_applied`
3. Added comprehensive error handling with try/except/finally blocks to ensure the flag is always reset

### Implementation Details
The solution follows this pattern in all relevant methods:

```python
@Slot(list)
def _on_some_signal(self, data):
    # Prevent signal loops
    if self._processing_signal:
        return
        
    try:
        self._processing_signal = True
        # Process the signal...
        # ...
    except Exception as e:
        self._logger.error(f"Error in _on_some_signal: {str(e)}")
        import traceback
        self._logger.error(traceback.format_exc())
    finally:
        self._processing_signal = False
```

### Lessons Learned
1. Always use guard flags for signal handlers that might trigger other signals
2. Ensure flags are reset in a `finally` block to prevent locks
3. Be cautious with auto-applying corrections or other actions that might trigger signal cascades
4. Add proper error handling to capture and log any exceptions in signal handlers

This pattern should be applied to any future signal handlers that might cause recursive signal processing.

## Signal Loop Prevention in DataManager Class
**Date Fixed**: March 18, 2025

### Issue Description
The application would fail to start, getting stuck in an infinite signal loop between DataManager and Dashboard during initialization. No error messages were shown, but the application would fail to display the main window.

### Root Cause
The DataManager's `set_correction_rules`, `set_validation_lists`, and `set_entries` methods did not have signal loop prevention. When these methods were triggered during application startup, they would emit signals that could trigger other components, which would then call back into DataManager methods, creating infinite signal loops.

### Solution
Implemented signal loop prevention mechanism in the DataManager class:

1. Added a `_processing_signal` flag to track when a signal is already being processed
2. Modified the following methods to check this flag and prevent re-entrance:
   - `set_correction_rules`
   - `set_validation_lists`
   - `set_entries`
3. Added checks to prevent unnecessary signal emissions when data hasn't changed
4. Added try/finally blocks to ensure the flag is always reset properly

### Implementation Details
The solution follows this pattern in all relevant methods:

```python
def set_some_data(self, data):
    # Prevent signal loops
    if self._processing_signal:
        self._logger.warning("Signal loop detected in set_some_data, skipping")
        return
        
    # If data is the same, don't process
    if self._some_data == data:
        self._logger.debug("Data is unchanged, skipping")
        return
            
    self._logger.info(f"Setting data in DataManager")
    
    try:
        self._processing_signal = True
        
        # Store the data
        self._some_data = data.copy()

        # Other processing...
        
        # Emit signal to notify components
        self._logger.info(f"Emitting data_changed signal")
        self.data_changed.emit(self._some_data)
    finally:
        self._processing_signal = False
```

### Lessons Learned
1. Signal loop prevention should be implemented in all central data managers
2. Always add checks to prevent unnecessary signal emissions when data hasn't changed
3. Timestamp logs are crucial for debugging signal-related issues
4. All signal emitting methods should follow this pattern to prevent cascading effects 

## Excessive rowCount Calls in CorrectionRulesTable
**Date Fixed**: March 18, 2025

### Issue Description
When loading an input list and navigating to the correction manager, the application would crash or become unresponsive. The console showed an excessive number of `rowCount called` log messages, indicating that the table view was triggering an unreasonable number of model queries.

### Root Cause
Several issues were identified:
1. The `CorrectionRulesTable` had no signal loop prevention, unlike other components
2. Debug logging in the `rowCount` method created excessive log entries
3. Multiple redundant updates were being triggered when setting rules
4. The `reset()` method triggered additional layout changes
5. Many methods were calling `viewport().update()` unnecessarily
6. There was no throttling of frequent update calls

### Solution
Implemented several optimizations to the `CorrectionRulesTable` class:

1. Added a `_processing_signal` flag to prevent signal loops
2. Added time-based throttling with a `_last_update_time` property
3. Modified the `rowCount` method to reduce log frequency (only log once per 100 calls)
4. Implemented proper signal loop prevention in all event handlers
5. Eliminated redundant viewport updates
6. Optimized the reset method to avoid triggering redundant layout changes
7. Added equality checks to prevent processing unchanged data

### Implementation Details
The optimization follows these patterns:

1. Signal loop prevention in all methods:
```python
def some_method(self, data):
    if self._processing_signal:
        logger.warning("Signal loop detected, skipping")
        return
        
    try:
        self._processing_signal = True
        # Process...
    finally:
        self._processing_signal = False
```

2. Time-based throttling:
```python
current_time = time.time()
if current_time - self._last_update_time < 0.1:
    logger.debug("Update throttled (too frequent), skipping")
    return
self._last_update_time = current_time
```

3. Reduced rowCount logging:
```python
if hasattr(self, '_rowcount_call_count'):
    self._rowcount_call_count += 1
    if self._rowcount_call_count % 100 == 0:
        self.logger.debug(f"rowCount called {self._rowcount_call_count} times, current count: {count}")
else:
    self._rowcount_call_count = 1
```

4. More targeted UI updates:
```python
# Only resize columns/rows on initial load or when explicitly requested
if len(rules) < 100:  # Only do this for small sets of rules
    self.resizeColumnsToContents()
    self.resizeRowsToContents()
```

### Lessons Learned
1. Always implement signal loop prevention in UI components that process model data
2. Use time-based throttling for operations that might be triggered frequently (filtering, updates)
3. Avoid excessive logging in frequently-called methods like `rowCount`
4. Batch UI updates and avoid redundant calls to `viewport().update()`
5. Be cautious with methods that trigger complex layout changes
6. Check for data equality before processing to avoid unnecessary work 

## Excessive Debug Logs and UI Refresh Issues
**Date Fixed**: March 18, 2025

### Issue Description
Several performance issues were identified in the application:
1. Excessive debug log entries were generated for every table entry during file parsing
2. The EnhancedTableView was reloading the same entries multiple times needlessly
3. Correction rules were not being displayed in the correction manager panel

### Root Cause
1. **Debug Log Spam**: In `FileParser._parse_text_content()`, every single entry creation was being logged at debug level without any throttling.
2. **Multiple Table Reloads**: The `EnhancedTableView.set_entries()` method lacked signal loop prevention and duplicate entry checking, causing redundant table reloads.
3. **Correction Rules Display Issues**: Several problems in the correction rules filtering:
   - The `filter_rules` method in `CorrectionRulesTable` was incorrectly implemented
   - The `rules_updated` signal wasn't properly defined or connected
   - Inadequate model updates and viewport refreshes

### Solution
1. **Reduce Debug Logging**: Modified the entry creation logging to only log the first entry and every 100th entry thereafter.
2. **Prevent Redundant Table Updates**: 
   - Added signal loop prevention with a `_processing_signal` flag
   - Added throttling to prevent updates more frequently than every 500ms
   - Added content comparison to skip redundant updates of identical data
3. **Fix Correction Rules Display**:
   - Properly implemented the `filter_rules` method to use the correct model instance
   - Added the `rules_updated` signal and connected it to the correction manager panel
   - Improved model reset and viewport update mechanisms
   - Added verbose logging to track filtering operations

### Implementation Details
1. **Debug Log Reduction**:
```python
# Only log occasionally (first entry, every 100th entry)
if current_id == 1 or current_id % 100 == 0:
    self.logger.debug(f"Creating entry #{current_id} from text: {entry_text}")
```

2. **Table Update Optimization**:
```python
# Prevent redundant processing
if hasattr(self, "_processing_signal") and self._processing_signal:
    logger.warning("Signal loop detected in set_entries, skipping")
    return
    
# Throttle updates to avoid excessive refreshes
current_time = time.time()
if hasattr(self, "_last_update_time") and current_time - self._last_update_time < 0.5:
    logger.debug("Update throttled (too frequent), skipping")
    return
```

3. **Correction Rules Filtering Fix**:
```python
# Get the model and set its filter
proxy_model = self.model()

# Set the filter text in the model if it has that attribute
if hasattr(proxy_model, "_filter_text"):
    proxy_model._filter_text = text
    
# Use the built-in filter method if available
if hasattr(proxy_model, "setFilterFixedString"):
    proxy_model.setFilterFixedString(text)

# Invalidate the filter to force re-filtering
proxy_model.invalidateFilter()
```

### Lessons Learned
1. **Logging Optimization**: Debug logging should be throttled or sampled for high-volume operations to prevent log spam and performance degradation.
2. **Signal Handling**: Always implement signal loop prevention and throttling in UI components that handle frequent updates.
3. **Model-View Separation**: Ensure proper implementation of the model-view-controller pattern, with clear responsibilities for each component.
4. **Defensive Programming**: Check for attribute existence and proper initialization before use, especially in UI components that might be updated from multiple sources.
5. **Viewport Updates**: Force viewport updates when necessary to ensure UI reflects the current state of the model. 

## Missing set_entries Method in EnhancedTableView
**Date Fixed**: March 19, 2025

### Issue Description
The application was crashing when importing an input file in the Dashboard with the following error:
```
AttributeError: 'EnhancedTableView' object has no attribute 'set_entries'. Did you mean: '_entries'?
```

The error occurred in multiple places:
1. `correction_manager_panel.py` line 691 in `set_entries`
2. `dashboard.py` line 1058 in `_apply_corrections`
3. `dashboard.py` line 912 in `_on_corrections_applied`

### Root Cause
A classic API design issue: The `set_entries` method existed in the `ChestEntryTableModel` class but not in the `EnhancedTableView` class. Code in several places was trying to call this method directly on `EnhancedTableView` instances, assuming the method existed there.

This likely happened because of refactoring - perhaps the method was moved from the view to the model, but not all places that called the method were updated.

### Solution
Added a proper `set_entries` method to the `EnhancedTableView` class that:
1. Takes a list of entries and passes them to a new model instance
2. Updates the proxy model with the new source model
3. Handles signal connections and view updates appropriately
4. Includes signal loop prevention and throttling logic

### Implementation Details
```python
def set_entries(self, entries):
    """
    Set the entries to display in the table.

    Args:
        entries: List of ChestEntry objects
    """
    # Log the operation for debugging
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    
    # Prevent redundant processing
    if hasattr(self, "_processing_signal") and self._processing_signal:
        logger.warning("Signal loop detected in EnhancedTableView.set_entries, skipping")
        return
        
    # Throttle updates to avoid excessive refreshes
    current_time = time.time()
    if hasattr(self, "_last_update_time") and current_time - self._last_update_time < 0.5:
        logger.debug("Update throttled (too frequent), skipping")
        return
    
    logger.debug(f"Setting {len(entries)} entries in EnhancedTableView")

    try:
        # Set flags to prevent recursive calls
        if not hasattr(self, "_processing_signal"):
            self._processing_signal = False
        if not hasattr(self, "_last_update_time"):
            self._last_update_time = 0
            
        self._processing_signal = True
        self._last_update_time = current_time
        
        # Store entries for direct access
        self._entries = list(entries)
        
        # Create a new model with the entries
        model = ChestEntryTableModel(self._entries)
        
        # Update or create proxy model
        if not hasattr(self, "_proxy_model") or self._proxy_model is None:
            self._proxy_model = QSortFilterProxyModel()
            self._proxy_model.setFilterCaseSensitivity(Qt.CaseInsensitive)
            self._proxy_model.setFilterKeyColumn(-1)  # Filter on all columns
            self.setModel(self._proxy_model)
        
        # Set the source model for the proxy
        self._proxy_model.setSourceModel(model)
        
        # Ensure selection signals are connected
        if self.selectionModel():
            self.selectionModel().selectionChanged.connect(self._on_selection_changed)
            
        # Refresh the view
        self._refresh_view()
        
        logger.debug(f"Successfully set {len(entries)} entries in EnhancedTableView")
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error setting entries in EnhancedTableView: {e}")
        import traceback
        logger.error(traceback.format_exc())
    finally:
        if hasattr(self, "_processing_signal"):
            self._processing_signal = False
```

### Lessons Learned
1. When refactoring code, ensure that all API calls are updated across the codebase
2. Follow the principle of "interface segregation" - don't call methods on objects that don't logically need them
3. When designing class hierarchies, be clear about which methods belong to which class
4. Include proper error checking and robust error handling in public methods
5. In UI components, always implement signal loop prevention mechanisms
6. Add thorough logging to help diagnose issues when they occur 

# Configuration Management Improvements

**Date Fixed:** March 18, 2025

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing issues with loading configuration settings, particularly paths to correction and validation lists. This resulted in multiple problems:

1. The correction list was being processed multiple times during startup
2. Files were being loaded from inconsistent locations
3. Path references were scattered across multiple config sections
4. Legacy configs were not backward compatible with new features
5. Multiple UI components were using different paths for the same file types

## Root Cause

1. **Configuration Structure**: The config file had multiple sections (General, Files, Validation, Correction) all containing different path references, leading to redundancy and inconsistency.
2. **Lack of Centralized Path Management**: Components accessed raw config sections directly rather than using a centralized path management API.
3. **Inconsistent Path Usage**: Some components used absolute paths, others used relative paths, leading to confusion and redundant loading.
4. **No Migration Mechanism**: When new config entries were added, there was no way to migrate from old structures to new ones.

## Solution

Implemented a comprehensive overhaul of the configuration management system:

1. **Consolidated Path Structure**: Created a unified "Paths" section in the config file that centralizes all file path references.
2. **Path Management API**: Added `get_path` and `set_path` methods to the ConfigManager to ensure consistent path retrieval and storage.
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Implemented redirection mechanisms for legacy config entries to maintain compatibility with existing code.
4. **Automatic Migration**: Added a migration system that runs on startup to convert old config structures to the new consolidated format.
5. **Default Directory Structure**: Ensured proper creation of standard directories (data, input, output, corrections, validation) on first run.
6. **Component Updates**: Modified all UI components and services to use the new path API consistently.

## Implementation Details

1. **ConfigManager Changes**:
   ```python
   def get_path(self, path_key, fallback=None):
       """Get a path from the consolidated Paths section with fallback to legacy sections."""
       # First try the new consolidated structure
       value = self.config.get("Paths", path_key, fallback=None)
       if value is not None:
           return value
       
       # If not found, try legacy paths based on predefined mappings
       legacy_mappings = {
           "correction_rules_file": [("General", "correction_list_path"), ("Correction", "correction_list")],
           "player_list_file": [("General", "player_list_path"), ("Validation", "player_list")],
           # ... other mappings ...
       }
       
       # Check legacy locations and migrate if found
       if path_key in legacy_mappings:
           for section, key in legacy_mappings[path_key]:
               legacy_value = self.config.get(section, key, fallback=None)
               if legacy_value:
                   # Migrate to new location and mark old as redirected
                   self.set_path(path_key, legacy_value)
                   self.config.set(section, key, f"REDIRECTED to Paths.{path_key}")
                   return legacy_value
       
       return fallback
   ```

2. **Dashboard Updates**:
   ```python
   def _load_saved_correction_rules(self):
       """Load saved correction rules from config."""
       # Use the consolidated path structure
       file_path = self._config.get_path("correction_rules_file")
       if file_path and Path(file_path).exists():
           self._load_correction_rules_from_file(file_path)
   ```

3. **Migration System**:
   ```python
   def migrate_config(self):
       """Migrate old configuration structure to new consolidated one."""
       # Define mappings of old locations to new keys
       path_mappings = {
           ("General", "last_folder"): "last_folder",
           ("Files", "default_input_dir"): "input_dir",
           ("Files", "default_output_dir"): "output_dir",
           # ... additional mappings ...
       }
       
       # Perform migration
       for (old_section, old_key), new_key in path_mappings.items():
           old_value = self.config.get(old_section, old_key, fallback=None)
           if old_value and not old_value.startswith("REDIRECTED"):
               # Save to new location and mark old as redirected
               self.set_path(new_key, old_value)
               self.config.set(old_section, old_key, f"REDIRECTED to Paths.{new_key}")
   ```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Centralized Configuration**: Use a centralized, well-structured config system to avoid redundancy and inconsistency.
2. **API-Based Access**: Provide a programmatic API for accessing config values rather than direct access to the underlying structure.
3. **Path Management**: Handle file paths consistently throughout the application, preferably using a dedicated subsystem.
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Always maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations when making structural changes.
5. **Automatic Migration**: Implement automatic migration systems to handle configuration updates seamlessly.
6. **Singleton Patterns**: While convenient, singleton patterns require careful implementation to avoid excessive instantiation.
7. **Directory Structure**: Ensure a clear, consistent directory structure for application data with proper default creation.

## Results

The application now properly loads configuration settings with several key improvements:

1. Correction lists and validation lists are loaded only once during startup
2. File paths are consistently stored and retrieved from a unified config section
3. Old configurations are automatically migrated to the new structure
4. All components use the same paths for the same file types
5. Default directories are properly created on first run
6. Legacy code continues to work through the redirection mechanism

These changes have significantly improved the stability and consistency of the application's configuration management system, eliminating issues with redundant file loading and inconsistent path references. 

## Data Management Issues

### Issue: Redundant Data Loading and Inconsistent State 
**Status**: Resolved with new design

**Symptoms**: 
- Multiple components load data independently
- Data inconsistencies between components 
- Changes in one view not reflected in others
- Performance issues with large datasets

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The application used multiple independent data structures for the same data, causing inconsistencies and redundant processing. Each UI component maintained its own copy of data, rather than sharing a single source of truth.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Created a centralized DataFrameStore that serves as the single source of truth
2. Implemented a transactional model for data updates
3. Added an event system for propagating changes
4. Used pandas DataFrames for efficient data processing
5. Implemented service classes with clear responsibilities:
   - DataFrameStore: Central data repository
   - FileService: File I/O operations
   - CorrectionService: Applying corrections
   - ValidationService: Entry validation
6. Created UI adapters to connect the data store to UI components:
   - EntryTableAdapter: For entry tables
   - ValidationListComboAdapter: For validation lists in combo boxes
   - CorrectionRuleTableAdapter: For correction rule tables
7. Created a ServiceFactory for centralized access to services and adapters

**Implementation Details**:
- DataFrameStore uses pandas DataFrame as the primary data structure
- All data operations go through the DataFrameStore
- Services handle specific functionality and use DataFrameStore for storage
- UI components communicate with services, not directly with data
- Changes are propagated through events, allowing loose coupling

**Verification**:
- Created a demo.py script to demonstrate the new data management system
- Verified that all services and adapters work together correctly
- Confirmed that transactions work properly (commit/rollback)
- Verified that changes are properly propagated through events

**Resources**:
- DataFrameStore: src/services/dataframe_store.py
- FileService: src/services/file_service.py
- CorrectionService: src/services/correction_service.py
- ValidationService: src/services/validation_service.py
- ServiceFactory: src/services/service_factory.py
- UI Adapters: src/ui/adapters/dataframe_adapter.py
- Demo: src/demo.py 

## File Format Handling Improvements
**Date Fixed**: March 19, 2025

### Issue Description
The integration test was failing when attempting to load real input files. There were multiple issues:
1. The file loading code expected empty lines as separators between entries, but the actual input files did not have them
2. The CSV parsing for correction rules was failing with "Required columns 'from_text' and 'to_text' not found" errors
3. The saved file format didn't match the expected input format, causing inconsistencies

### Root Cause
1. The file loading logic in `load_entries_from_file` was designed with an expectation of empty line separators between entries, but the actual file format didn't include these
2. The CSV parsing was too rigid, only attempting to read with fixed separators and without handling improperly formatted files
3. The `save_entries_to_file` method was adding empty lines after each entry, which didn't match the expected format

### Solution
1. **File loading improvements**:
   - Rewritten the `load_entries_from_file` method to detect entries without empty line separators
   - Added support for detecting chest type lines vs. player/source lines
   - Added proper initialization of empty entries

2. **CSV parsing enhancements**:
   - Implemented intelligent separator detection (comma vs semicolon)
   - Added a fallback parsing method for malformed CSV files
   - Created multiple approaches to identify column headers
   - Added support for extracting data from concatenated column names
   - Improved handling of special characters and encodings

3. **File saving format corrections**:
   - Updated the `save_entries_to_file` method to match the expected format
   - Removed the empty lines between entries
   - Added proper error handling and logging

### Implementation Details
1. **File Loading Improvements**:
```python
def load_entries_from_file(self, file_path):
    entries = []
    current_entry = None
    
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            for line in file:
                line = line.strip()
                if not line:
                    continue
                    
                if line.startswith("From:"):
                    # This is a player line
                    if current_entry is not None:
                        current_entry["player"] = line[5:].strip()
                elif line.startswith("Source:"):
                    # This is a source line
                    if current_entry is not None:
                        current_entry["source"] = line[7:].strip()
                else:
                    # This might be a chest type line, which starts a new entry
                    # If we already have a current entry, append it to entries
                    if current_entry is not None:
                        entries.append(current_entry)
                    
                    # Start a new entry
                    current_entry = {
                        "chest_type": line,
                        "player": "",
                        "source": "",
                        "status": "pending",
                        "date": pd.Timestamp.now()
                    }
            
            # Don't forget the last entry
            if current_entry is not None:
                entries.append(current_entry)
    except Exception as e:
        self._logger.error(f"Error loading entries from {file_path}: {str(e)}")
        raise
    
    # Create DataFrame from entries
    if entries:
        entries_df = pd.DataFrame(entries)
    else:
        # If no entries were loaded, create an empty DataFrame with expected columns
        entries_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=["chest_type", "player", "source", "status", "date"])
    
    # Initialize validation_errors and original_values as empty objects
    entries_df["validation_errors"] = [[] for _ in range(len(entries_df))]
    entries_df["original_values"] = [{} for _ in range(len(entries_df))]
    
    self._logger.info(f"Loaded {len(entries_df)} entries from {file_path}")
    return entries_df
```

2. **Enhanced CSV Parsing**:
```python
def load_correction_rules_from_csv(self, file_path):
    # Enhanced CSV parsing with multiple fallback methods
    try:
        # Read the raw file first to inspect the format
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            first_line = f.readline().strip()
        
        # Try to detect the separator
        if ',' in first_line and ';' in first_line:
            # Complex case, use default separator
            sep = ';'
        elif ',' in first_line:
            sep = ','
        elif ';' in first_line:
            sep = ';'
        else:
            sep = ','
        
        # Try multiple parsing approaches
        try:
            rules_df = pd.read_csv(file_path, sep=sep)
        except Exception:
            try:
                # Try with alternative separator
                alt_sep = ',' if sep == ';' else ';'
                rules_df = pd.read_csv(file_path, sep=alt_sep)
            except Exception:
                # If still failing, try manual parsing
                # ... manual parsing code ...
        
        # ... column renaming and validation ...
        
        # Handle malformed header cases
        if 'from_text' not in rules_df.columns or 'to_text' not in rules_df.columns:
            # Check if first column contains multiple parts
            first_col = rules_df.columns[0]
            if isinstance(first_col, str) and (',' in first_col or ';' in first_col):
                # Try to split it into separate columns
                # ... header parsing code ...
        
        # ... data cleanup and validation ...
        
        return len(rules_df)
    except Exception as e:
        self._logger.error(f"Error loading correction rules: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

3. **File Saving Improvements**:
```python
def save_entries_to_file(self, entries_df, file_path):
    try:
        if len(entries_df) == 0:
            self._logger.warning(f"No entries to save to {file_path}")
            return 0
            
        with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            for _, entry in entries_df.iterrows():
                # Write the chest type
                file.write(f"{entry['chest_type']}\n")
                
                # Write the player (with From: prefix)
                if pd.notna(entry['player']) and entry['player']:
                    file.write(f"From: {entry['player']}\n")
                
                # Write the source if available (with Source: prefix)
                if pd.notna(entry['source']) and entry['source']:
                    file.write(f"Source: {entry['source']}\n")
                
        self._logger.info(f"Saved {len(entries_df)} entries to {file_path}")
        return len(entries_df)
    except Exception as e:
        self._logger.error(f"Error saving entries to {file_path}: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

### Lessons Learned
1. Always verify file format expectations against actual input files
2. Implement robust error handling and recovery for file operations
3. Use multiple fallback strategies for parsing files with varying formats
4. Test with real-world data early in development
5. Maintain format consistency between input and output files
6. Add detailed logging for all file operations
7. Develop flexible parsers that can handle different separators and formats

These improvements significantly enhance the robustness of the data management system when working with real-world data files that may have inconsistent formatting or structure. 

## Interface Duplication Cleanup (2025-03-19)

### Issue
The project contained duplicate interface definitions in the `src/interfaces` directory.
There were pairs of files like `file_service.py`/`i_file_service.py`, `data_store.py`/`i_data_store.py`, etc.
Both types of files contained interface definitions with abstract methods, causing confusion.

### Solution
1. Updated `src/interfaces/__init__.py` to import from the `i_*` prefixed files only
2. Removed the non-prefixed duplicate interface files:
   - `src/interfaces/file_service.py`
   - `src/interfaces/data_store.py`
   - `src/interfaces/correction_service.py`
   - `src/interfaces/validation_service.py`
   - `src/interfaces/config_manager.py`
   - `src/interfaces/service_factory.py`
3. Updated imports in affected files:
   - `src/services/config_manager.py`
   - `src/models/validation_list.py`
4. Implemented missing abstract methods in `ConfigManager` to satisfy the interface contract

### Result
- Cleaner codebase with a single, consistent interface definition pattern
- All tests passing with the standardized i_* interface naming convention
- Better maintainability and organization of the interface-based architecture

## Correction Rules Format Standardization
**Date Fixed**: 2025-03-19

### Issue Description
The application was experiencing issues with correction rules due to redundant and inconsistent column formats in the DataFrame. The system was supporting multiple column naming schemas (old: "From"/"To"/"Category" and new: "from_text"/"to_text"/"category") simultaneously, creating duplicate data in the DataFrame that caused confusion when processing rules.

### Root Cause
The `load_correction_rules` method in `file_service.py` was creating copies of the data with different column names rather than truly converting between formats. This resulted in a DataFrame with both sets of columns (e.g., both "From" and "from_text" containing the same data), which caused issues when the data was converted to dictionaries and processed by other components.

### Solution
1. Standardized the correction rules format to a single schema with columns "from_text", "to_text", "category", and "enabled" for internal processing
2. Added a clean column mapping system in `file_service.py` that renames columns instead of duplicating data
3. Simplified the import/export methods to maintain backward compatibility while using a consistent internal format
4. Created a new documentation file `correction_rules_format.md` detailing the standardized format
5. Updated all code that interacts with correction rules to expect the standardized format only

### Lessons Learned
1. Maintain a single source of truth for data formats
2. Perform clean conversions between user-facing formats and internal formats
3. Document standard formats clearly to avoid confusion
4. Rename columns rather than duplicating data with different names
5. When dealing with multiple possible input formats, standardize them at the entry point rather than propagating multiple formats throughout the system

The application now handles correction rules with a consistent internal representation while maintaining user-friendly column names in exported files. 

## Event System Standardization

### Issue: Multiple EventType Implementations
- **Date**: [Current Date]
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Description**: The application had multiple competing implementations of the `EventType` enum:
  1. In `src/enums/event_type.py`
  2. In `src/interfaces/events.py`
  3. Directly within `src/services/dataframe_store.py`
  
  This created confusion for developers and potential errors when subscribing to events.

### Resolution
1. Standardized the `EventType` enum by:
   - Consolidating all event types into `src/interfaces/events.py`
   - Making other instances re-export from the central definition
   - Adding proper typing for event handlers and event data
   
2. Updated `DataFrameStore` to:
   - Implement the `IDataStore` interface properly
   - Use standard event types and handlers
   - Return proper boolean values from all transaction methods

3. Fixed service methods to:
   - Import from the standardized event type source
   - Use proper type annotations for events

4. Added comprehensive test coverage in `tests/test_event_system_standardization.py`

### Impact
This standardization resolves issues with event propagation and ensures consistent behavior across the application. It provides a more maintainable event system architecture with proper type hints for developers.

### Related Changes
- Modified `src/interfaces/events.py` - Standardized EventType
- Updated `src/enums/event_type.py` - Now re-exports from interfaces
- Modified `src/services/dataframe_store.py` - Removed local definition
- Updated `src/interfaces/i_data_store.py` - Added event subscription methods
- Modified all service implementations to use the standardized event types 

## Dependency Injection Refinement

### Issue: Inconsistent Service Access Patterns
- **Date**: [Current Date]
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Description**: The application had inconsistent patterns for accessing services:
  1. Direct instantiation of service classes
  2. Mixed use of singleton and non-singleton patterns
  3. Inconsistent helper functions in the services package
  
  This created confusion and potential errors when accessing services throughout the application.

### Resolution
1. Standardized the ServiceFactory as a proper singleton:
   - Added thread-safe singleton implementation with `get_instance()` method
   - Updated the AppBootstrapper to use the singleton

2. Improved helper functions in `src/services/__init__.py`:
   - Added a generic `get_service()` function for type-safe service access
   - Simplified specific service getter functions to use the generic function
   - Added proper type annotations

3. Created a comprehensive test suite for the dependency injection system:
   - Verified singleton behavior
   - Tested service resolution through multiple access methods
   - Validated interface compliance for all services

### Impact
This standardization resolves issues with inconsistent service access patterns, reduces the risk of duplicate service instances, and provides a cleaner, more maintainable API for accessing services. The consistent dependency injection pattern also makes the codebase more testable.

### Related Changes
- Modified `src/services/service_factory.py` - Added proper singleton pattern
- Updated `src/app_bootstrapper.py` - Now uses ServiceFactory singleton
- Improved `src/services/__init__.py` - Standardized service access functions
- Added `tests/test_dependency_injection.py` - Tests for dependency injection system 

## Interface Compliance Verification Completed
**Date Completed**: March 22, 2025

### Improvements Implemented
We have successfully completed Phase 3 of our interface system implementation plan, which involved comprehensive verification of interface compliance across the application. The following improvements were implemented:

1. **Test Suite for Interface Compliance**:
   - Created `tests/test_interface_compliance.py` with general interface compliance tests
   - Created service-specific tests (`test_datastore_interface_compliance.py`, `test_service_factory_interface_compliance.py`)
   - Implemented tests for method signature compatibility, inheritance verification, and runtime behavior

2. **Mock Implementation Improvements**:
   - Enhanced mock implementations in test files to fully implement all required interface methods
   - Fixed multiple missing method implementations in mock services
   - Added proper typing to mock implementations

3. **DataFrameStore Interface Compliance**:
   - Corrected validation list handling to properly implement the IDataStore interface
   - Fixed boolean comparison issues with pandas DataFrames
   - Ensured consistent error handling and return values

4. **ServiceFactory Interface Compliance**:
   - Verified service registration and resolution
   - Ensured proper implementation of singleton pattern
   - Fixed helper functions to properly handle service creation

### Lessons Learned

1. **Interface Implementation Challenges**:
   - **Boolean Comparison**: Pandas DataFrame boolean values require special handling (`bool(value)` vs `value is True`)
   - **Method Signature Matching**: Parameter and return type annotations must exactly match between interface and implementation
   - **Mock Services**: Mock services must fully implement all abstract methods, even for testing

2. **Testing Best Practices**:
   - Use pytest fixtures to create reusable service instances
   - Test both static compliance (method existence, signature) and runtime behavior
   - Verify interface inheritance and instance checks
   - Create specialized tests for edge cases in each interface

3. **Interface Evolution Guidelines**:
   - Document any changes to interfaces clearly
   - Maintain backward compatibility when possible
   - Consider creating base classes with default implementations for common behavior
   - Use interface segregation to keep interfaces focused on specific responsibilities

4. **Implementation Patterns**:
   - Prefer composition over inheritance for complex implementations
   - Use adapter pattern for connecting components with different interfaces
   - Follow consistent error handling patterns across implementations
   - Document interface contracts with comprehensive docstrings

### Open Tasks
- Update interface documentation with examples and best practices
- Create developer guide for interface usage and testing
- Review remaining UI components for interface compliance
- Enhance error messages for interface compliance issues 

## Drag-Drop Adapter Bug Fixes
**Date Fixed**: March 19, 2025

### Issues Fixed
We resolved critical bugs in the drag-drop functionality that were preventing the application from starting correctly:

1. **ValidationListDragDropAdapter Issues**:
   - The adapter was attempting to access a non-existent `list_view` attribute in the `ValidationListWidget` class
   - Fixed by updating the adapter to use the correct `_table_view` attribute instead
   - The widget uses a QTableView for its list display, not a QListView as the adapter assumed

2. **CorrectionRulesDragDropAdapter Issues**:
   - The adapter was looking for a `table_widget` attribute in the `CorrectionRulesTable` class
   - Fixed by modifying the adapter to use the widget itself directly, since `CorrectionRulesTable` inherits from QTableView
   - This change simplifies the adapter and aligns with the widget's actual implementation

3. **Qt Event Handling Issues**:
   - Both adapters were using incorrect event type references (Qt.QEvent.Type.* or Qt.*)
   - Fixed by updating to use the correct PySide6 format: QEvent.*
   - Added explicit QEvent import from PySide6.QtCore to both adapter files

### Root Causes
1. **Widget Structure Mismatch**: The adapters were developed with assumptions about widget internal structure that didn't match the actual implementation.
2. **Qt API Changes**: The event type references may have worked in older versions of PySide6 but are no longer valid.
3. **Incomplete Testing**: The drag-drop functionality was likely not thoroughly tested prior to integration.

### Implementation Changes
1. Updated ValidationListDragDropAdapter:
   ```python
   # Before:
   self._list_view = self._widget.list_view
   
   # After:
   self._table_view = self._widget._table_view
   ```

2. Updated CorrectionRulesDragDropAdapter:
   ```python
   # Before:
   self._table = self._widget.table_widget
   
   # After:
   self._table = self._widget  # Direct use of widget
   ```

3. Fixed Event Handling:
   ```python
   # Before:
   if event.type() == Qt.QEvent.Type.DragEnter:
   
   # After:
   if event.type() == QEvent.DragEnter:
   ```

### Testing & Verification
- Manually tested the application startup to verify all initialization steps complete successfully
- Verified that validation lists and correction rules table load properly
- Confirmed that drag-drop operations between validation lists and correction rules table work as expected

### Documentation Updates
- Updated drag_drop_functionality.md with implementation details and lessons learned
- Added explicit compatibility notes for Qt event handling

### Lessons Learned
1. **Widget Assumptions**: Don't make assumptions about widget internal structure; verify through code inspection or documentation
2. **Event Type Constants**: Use explicit QEvent imports and references for better compatibility
3. **Testing Strategy**: Implement more comprehensive testing for UI component interactions

## Main Window Files Cleanup - Pending Task

### Issue Description
The project currently has multiple main window implementations that need to be consolidated:
- `src/ui/main_window.py` - Original implementation
- `src/ui/main_window_refactor.py` - Interim refactoring
- `src/ui/main_window_bridge.py` - Bridge class for transitioning
- `src/ui/main_window_interface.py` - New interface-based implementation

These redundant files create confusion and maintenance overhead. According to our interface system implementation plan, we need to clean up these files and standardize on the interface-based implementation.

### Status
- Pending cleanup
- Part of the interface system implementation plan
- The application currently uses MainWindowInterface successfully through the bridge class

### Implementation Plan
1. Remove redundant main window implementations (main_window.py, main_window_refactor.py)
2. Remove bridge class (main_window_bridge.py)
3. Update imports to use MainWindowInterface directly
4. Update documentation to reflect the removal of legacy main window implementations
5. Test application after cleanup to ensure functionality is preserved

### Related Files
- `src/ui/__init__.py` - Imports main_window.py
- `run_refactored_app.py` - Uses main_window_refactor.py
- `run_interface_app.py` - Uses get_main_window() function
- Various test files that may reference the legacy implementations

### Expected Benefits
- Reduced code complexity
- Simplified imports and dependencies
- Clearer architecture for new developers
- Better maintainability in the long term

### Priority
High - This task should be completed before implementing new features to ensure a clean codebase foundation.

## Main Window Cleanup - Progress Update (March 25, 2025)

### Status
- In progress - significant progress made
- Bridge classes have been successfully removed
- MainWindowInterface is being used directly in all run files

### Completed Steps
1. âœ… Verified that MainWindowInterface preserves styling and layout from original implementation
2. âœ… Updated run_interface_app.py to use MainWindowInterface correctly
3. âœ… Updated run_refactored_app.py to use MainWindowInterface with proper service initialization
4. âœ… Confirmed that main.py already directly uses MainWindowInterface
5. âœ… Removed bridge classes (main_window_bridge.py and dashboard_bridge.py)
6. âœ… Tested the application after bridge class removal and confirmed it works correctly

### Remaining Tasks
1. â¬œ Remove redundant main window implementations (main_window.py, main_window_refactor.py)
2. â¬œ Update any remaining imports to use MainWindowInterface directly
3. â¬œ Update documentation to reflect the simplified architecture
4. â¬œ Perform final testing of the cleaned-up codebase

### Issues Encountered and Solutions
- No issues were encountered during the bridge class removal, as they were primarily used as compatibility layers and not deeply integrated into the application
- The application continued to function correctly after bridge class removal, indicating that the direct use of interfaces is working as expected

### Benefits Realized
- Reduced code complexity by removing unnecessary abstraction layers
- Simplified imports and dependencies by using interface implementations directly
- Improved code clarity for future developers by standardizing on the interface-based architecture
- Better maintainability through consistent architectural patterns

## ValidationListWidget `items` Property/Method Differentiation
**Date**: 2024-03-21

**Issue**: The `ValidationListWidget.populate()` and `_filter_items()` methods were failing with `AttributeError` when `items` was being treated as a method while it was actually an attribute/property in some cases.

**Root Cause**: The `ValidationListWidget` class was written assuming that `items` is always a callable method, but in some cases, the validation list passed to the widget had `items` as a property instead. The code wasn't checking the type before attempting to call it.

**Solution**: Added checks to differentiate between when `items` is a callable method versus when it is a property:

```python
def populate(self):
    """Populate the list widget with items from the validation list."""
    if not self._list:
        return

    # Get the items from the validation list
    items = None
    if isinstance(self._list, pd.DataFrame):
        # Special handling for DataFrames
        if len(self._list.columns) > 0:
            items = self._list.iloc[:, 0].tolist()
    elif hasattr(self._list, 'items') and callable(self._list.items):
        # If items is a method, call it
        items = self._list.items()
    elif hasattr(self._list, 'items'):
        # If items is a property, access it directly
        items = self._list.items
    else:
        # Try to use the list directly
        items = self._list

    # ... existing code to add items to the widget ...
```

Similar changes were made to the `_filter_items()` method.

**Status**: âœ… Fixed and verified.

**Prevention**: When working with interfaces that might have different implementations (property vs method), always check the type or use `callable()` to determine if something is a method before attempting to call it.

## ValidationListsControlPanel Statistics Update Error
**Date**: 2024-03-21

**Issue**: The `ValidationListsControlPanel._update_statistics()` method was failing with an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `.entries` attribute on validation lists that don't have it (like DataFrames).

**Root Cause**: The code was assuming all validation lists have an `entries` attribute, but DataFrames have a different structure and use `.shape[0]` to get the row count.

**Solution**: Updated the code to handle different types of validation lists, particularly DataFrames:

```python
def _update_statistics(self):
    """Update the statistics panel with information about the validation lists."""
    if not self._validation_lists:
        return
    
    for list_name, validation_list in self._validation_lists.items():
        widget = self._widgets.get(list_name)
        if not widget:
            continue
        
        # Get the count of items in the validation list
        count = 0
        if isinstance(validation_list, pd.DataFrame):
            count = validation_list.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(validation_list, 'entries') and validation_list.entries:
            count = len(validation_list.entries)
        elif hasattr(validation_list, 'items') and callable(validation_list.items):
            items = validation_list.items()
            count = len(items) if items else 0
        elif hasattr(validation_list, 'items'):
            count = len(validation_list.items) if validation_list.items else 0
        else:
            # Try to get length directly
            try:
                count = len(validation_list)
            except (TypeError, AttributeError):
                count = 0
        
        # Update the statistics label
        stat_label = widget.findChild(QLabel, f"{list_name}_stat_label")
        if stat_label:
            stat_label.setText(f"Items: {count}")
```

**Status**: âœ… Fixed and verified.

**Prevention**: When working with objects that might have different structures or interfaces, use type checks or hasattr() to handle each type appropriately.

## ValidationListWidget Missing set_validation_list Method
**Date**: 2024-03-22

**Issue**: The `ValidationListWidget` did not have a `set_validation_list` method, causing errors when this method was called in `CorrectionManagerInterface`.

**Root Cause**: The `ValidationListWidget` class was designed to be initialized with a validation list, but there was no method to update the list after creation. The `CorrectionManagerInterface` was trying to call this non-existent method when validation lists were updated.

**Solution**: Added a `set_validation_list` method to the `ValidationListWidget` class:

```python
def set_validation_list(self, validation_list):
    """
    Set the validation list and populate the widget.
    
    Args:
        validation_list: The validation list to display
    """
    self._list = validation_list
    self.populate()
```

**Status**: âœ… Fixed and verified.

**Prevention**: When creating UI components that may need to be updated after initialization, always include appropriate setter methods.

## UI Testing Framework Implementation
**Date**: 2024-03-22

**Issue**: The application lacked automated tests for UI components, making it difficult to verify that UI elements function correctly and that required data is displayed to the user.

**Root Cause**: The project initially focused on core functionality without implementing comprehensive UI testing. This led to difficulty in identifying and resolving UI issues, such as the validation entries not showing in the correction manager and buttons not working.

**Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive UI testing framework with:

1. Created a hierarchical test structure:
   ```
   tests/ui/
   â”œâ”€â”€ components/         # Component-level tests
   â”œâ”€â”€ integration/        # Integration tests for interactions
   â”œâ”€â”€ helpers/            # Testing utilities and helpers
   â””â”€â”€ fixtures/           # Pytest fixtures for UI testing
   ```

2. Created mock services for testing UI components in isolation:
   - `MockDataStore`: Simulates data storage without actual persistence
   - `MockConfigManager`: Simulates configuration without file I/O
   - `MockFileService`: Simulates file operations without file system access
   - `MockCorrectionService`: Simulates correction rule application without actual processing
   - `MockValidationService`: Simulates validation without actual processing
   - `MockServiceFactory`: Provides access to all mock services

3. Implemented a `UITestHelper` class with methods for:
   - Creating test widgets
   - Simulating user interactions
   - Verifying widget states
   - Finding widgets and extracting their data

4. Created base test fixtures for:
   - QT bot setup
   - Default service creation
   - Sample data generation
   - Common test setups

5. Developed component tests for `ValidationListWidget` and `CorrectionManagerInterface`

6. Created integration tests for button interactions and validation list functionality

7. Implemented pytest configuration for UI testing in `conftest.py`

8. Created a test runner script for easy execution of tests

**Status**: âœ… Implemented and ready for use.

**Next Steps**:
1. Expand test coverage to include all UI components
2. Add end-to-end tests for complete workflows
3. Integrate UI tests into the CI/CD pipeline
4. Create custom markers for different test categories

**Benefits**:
1. Easier identification of UI issues
2. Prevention of regressions during development
3. More reliable UI components
4. Better documentation of expected UI behavior## ValidationListWidget `items` Property/Method Differentiation
**Date**: 2024-03-21

**Issue**: The `ValidationListWidget.populate()` and `_filter_items()` methods were failing with `AttributeError` when `items` was being treated as a method while it was actually an attribute/property in some cases.

**Root Cause**: The `ValidationListWidget` class was written assuming that `items` is always a callable method, but in some cases, the validation list passed to the widget had `items` as a property instead. The code wasn't checking the type before attempting to call it.

**Solution**: Added checks to differentiate between when `items` is a callable method versus when it is a property:

```python
def populate(self):
    """Populate the list widget with items from the validation list."""
    if not self._list:
        return

    # Get the items from the validation list
    items = None
    if isinstance(self._list, pd.DataFrame):
        # Special handling for DataFrames
        if len(self._list.columns) > 0:
            items = self._list.iloc[:, 0].tolist()
    elif hasattr(self._list, 'items') and callable(self._list.items):
        # If items is a method, call it
        items = self._list.items()
    elif hasattr(self._list, 'items'):
        # If items is a property, access it directly
        items = self._list.items
    else:
        # Try to use the list directly
        items = self._list

    # ... existing code to add items to the widget ...
```

Similar changes were made to the `_filter_items()` method.

**Status**: âœ… Fixed and verified.

**Prevention**: When working with interfaces that might have different implementations (property vs method), always check the type or use `callable()` to determine if something is a method before attempting to call it.
