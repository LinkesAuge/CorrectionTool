# Data Management Refactoring Progress

## Core Components Implemented

1. **DataFrameStore**: Central singleton data store using pandas DataFrames for all data management
   - Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
   - Transaction support (begin, commit, rollback)
   - Caching for performance optimization
   - Statistics and querying capabilities

2. **Service Layer**: Core services for specific data operations
   - FileService: Handles file loading and saving
     - Robust parsing of entry files without requiring empty line separators
     - Flexible CSV parsing for correction rules with different formats
     - Proper handling of character encodings and separator detection
   - CorrectionService: Applies correction rules to entries
   - ValidationService: Validates entries against validation lists
   - ServiceFactory: Creates and manages service instances

3. **UI Adapters**: Connect DataFrameStore to UI components
   - DataFrameTableModel: Qt table model for DataFrames
   - EntryTableAdapter: Connects entries to table views
   - CorrectionRuleTableAdapter: Connects rules to table views
   - ValidationListComboAdapter: Connects validation lists to combo boxes

## Features Implemented

- **Central Data Storage**: All data is now stored in a single source of truth

  - Connected correction actions to CorrectionService
  - Added validation via ValidationService

## Current Challenges

### Circular Dependencies

We've identified a circular dependency chain that prevents the refactored MainWindow from being directly used in the application:

1. `src/models/validation_list.py` imports `src/services/config_manager.py`
2. `src/services/__init__.py` imports `src/services/service_factory.py`
3. `src/services/service_factory.py` imports UI adapters from `src/ui/adapters/dataframe_adapter.py`
4. `src/ui/__init__.py` imports `src/ui/main_window.py`
5. `src/ui/main_window.py` imports `src/models/validation_list.py`

The integration test successfully avoids these circular dependencies by:
- Using standalone versions of core components (dataframe_store_test.py, ui_adapter_test.py)
- Implementing the required functionality in isolated classes
- Using dependency injection instead of direct imports

### Validation Errors

We've also identified some validation errors in the integration test:
- The error "'list' object has no attribute 'empty'" indicates compatibility issues between the test implementation and the main code
- Some inconsistencies exist between the validation behavior in the test and main implementations

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Circular Dependencies**:
   - Create a new `src/interfaces` package with interface classes for core services
   - Modify existing components to use interfaces instead of concrete implementations
   - Implement proper dependency injection throughout the application
   - Restructure package imports to create a clean dependency hierarchy
   - Create an application bootstrapper to handle initialization

2. **Fix Validation Errors**:
   - Address the "'list' object has no attribute 'empty'" error
   - Ensure consistent behavior across test and main implementations
   - Standardize validation methods and error handling

3. **Complete Integration**:
   - Finalize the MainWindow refactoring after resolving circular dependencies
   - Ensure all UI components work correctly with the new architecture
   - Implement comprehensive error handling and user notifications

4. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Optimize operations for large datasets
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add pagination for large tables

5. **Update Documentation**:
   - Fully document the new architecture
   - Create a user guide for the refactored application
   - Update developer documentation for future maintenance

## Integration Strategy

The integration strategy follows these steps:

1. ✅ Replace direct data access with service calls
2. ✅ Connect UI components to adapters 
3. ✅ Refactor UI components to use the event system
4. ⬜ Resolve circular dependencies with interface-based architecture
5. ⬜ Add proper error handling
6. ⬜ Optimize performance
