# Event System Standardization

## Overview
The event system standardization project aims to establish a consistent approach to event handling throughout the application. This includes creating a centralized EventManager, standardizing event types, and ensuring all components use the event system correctly.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created a centralized EventManager class to manage event subscriptions and emissions
- [x] Defined standard EventType enum with categorized event types
- [x] Implemented thread-safe event handling
- [x] Added exception handling to prevent event propagation failures
- [x] Created comprehensive unit tests for the EventManager
- [x] Developed integration test to demonstrate component communication
- [x] Added documentation for the event system usage

## Current Status
The event system standardization is complete. The EventManager has been implemented and tested, and documentation has been created to guide its use throughout the application.

### Key Components
1. **EventType Enum** (`src/interfaces/events.py`): Defines all possible event types
2. **EventManager Class** (`src/services/event_manager.py`): Provides methods for subscribing to, unsubscribing from, and emitting events
3. **Unit Tests** (`tests/test_event_manager.py`): Verify the functionality of the EventManager
4. **Integration Tests** (`tests/test_event_system_integration.py`): Demonstrate how components can communicate through events
5. **Documentation** (`docs/event_system_usage.md`): Provides examples and best practices for using the event system

## Next Steps
1. Audit existing code to identify components that should use the event system
2. Refactor components to use the EventManager where appropriate
3. Ensure all UI components properly subscribe to relevant events
4. Verify event unsubscription during component disposal to prevent memory leaks

## Design Considerations
- **Loose Coupling**: Components should not depend directly on each other
- **Thread Safety**: The EventManager is thread-safe, but event handlers must also be thread-safe
- **Performance**: Event handlers should be efficient as they may be called frequently
- **Recursion Prevention**: Care must be taken to prevent infinite recursion in event handlers
- **Standardization**: All event types should be defined in the EventType enum

## Technical Implementation
The EventManager uses a class-level dictionary to store event handlers, with thread-safe access using a RLock. Event handlers are called with event data, and exceptions in handlers are caught and logged to prevent disruption to event propagation.

```python
# Class-level dictionary of event handlers
_event_handlers: Dict[EventType, Set[EventHandler]] = {
    event_type: set() for event_type in EventType
}

# Thread safety lock
_lock = threading.RLock()
```

Event emission includes the event type in the data dictionary for reference:
```python
# Add event type to the data for reference
event_data["event_type"] = event_type
```
