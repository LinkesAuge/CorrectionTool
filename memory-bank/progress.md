   - Add signal history tracking to all components
   - Test signal connections between components
   - Verify correct signal payloads

3. **Interface Documentation**
   - Update documentation with new testing approaches
   - Document test mode pattern for developers
   - Create examples of dialog component testing

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile application with large datasets
   - Implement optimizations for DataFrameStore
   - Add pagination for large tables

## Status Summary

The application is stable with core functionality in place. Recent work has focused on implementing a comprehensive UI testing framework, particularly for headless environments. The newly established test mode pattern provides a consistent approach for testing UI components in automated CI/CD environments. Dialog components testing is the next priority, followed by comprehensive signal testing and performance optimization.
