# Project Brief: Chest Tracker Correction Tool

## Core Purpose
The Chest Tracker Correction Tool is designed to read, process, and correct text input generated by an OCR app for the game "Total Battle". The application's primary purpose is to fix OCR errors such as wrong characters and bad text encoding based on a provided correction list.

## Core Requirements

### Input Processing
- Parse text files containing chest entries (chest type, player, source)
- Process multi-line data in the structure of 3 lines per entry
- Handle batched processing of multiple files

### Correction System
- Apply string replacements based on a CSV correction list template (From â†’ To columns)
- Support both exact and fuzzy matching for error detection
- Manage the correction rules with add/edit/delete capabilities
- Track corrections for reporting and analysis

### Validation System
- Maintain validation lists for players, chest types, and sources
- Import/export validation lists from/to text files
- Support fuzzy matching with configurable strictness levels
- Provide visual feedback for validation errors

### User Interface
- Modern dashboard interface using PySide6
- Comprehensive table view with validation error highlighting
- Split-panel layout with sidebar for actions and main content area
- Dedicated correction manager panel for rule management

### Data Management
- Centralized data management through DataFrameStore
- Consistent file handling with configurable paths
- Automatic config migration for backward compatibility
- State persistence between application sessions

## Project Scope
The application focuses specifically on the OCR correction workflow for Total Battle chest data. It does not include features for game data analysis, player performance tracking, or other game-specific metrics beyond the correction of OCR errors.

## Key Technical Decisions
- Python 3.12+ as the development language
- PySide6 for GUI development
- pandas for data management and operations
- UV for dependency management and virtual environment
- pytest for testing

## Project Timeline
The project is currently in an active development phase with ongoing improvements to the architecture, UI, and core functionality.
