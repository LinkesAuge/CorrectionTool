# Project Status

## Overview
The Chest Tracker Correction Tool is an application for managing and correcting data entries related to chest tracking. The application is undergoing a refactoring and improvement phase with several key areas of focus.

## Current Status

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Main window cleanup (removal of legacy implementations)
- [x] Event system standardization
- [x] Configuration Manager improvements
- [x] DataFrameStore corrections

### Ongoing Tasks
- [ ] UI component standardization
- [ ] Validation system improvements
- [ ] Correction rule engine enhancements
- [ ] Test coverage expansion

### Planned Tasks
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] User experience improvements

## Component Status

### Main Window Interface
- Status: **Stable**
- The MainWindowInterface has been established as the standard implementation
- Legacy implementations (main_window.py, main_window_refactor.py) have been removed
- All tests are passing

### Event System
- Status: **Complete**
- Centralized EventManager implemented
- Standard EventType enum defined
- Unit and integration tests passing
- Documentation created

### Data Management
- Status: **Stable**
- DataFrameStore has been corrected and is functioning properly
- ValidationListWidget issues have been resolved
- Some column mapping improvements have been implemented

### Configuration
- Status: **Stable**
- ConfigManager has been updated to handle missing sections
- Default configuration values have been properly defined
- UI state persistence is working correctly

### Validation System
- Status: **Under Review**
- Current validation logic works but needs improvements
- Need to enhance error reporting and user feedback

### Correction System
- Status: **Functional**
- Correction rules are applied correctly
- Legacy correction rule files can be loaded
- Some improvements needed for rule management

### UI Components
- Status: **Mixed**
- ValidationListWidget has been fixed
- Some components need standardization
- Event handling in UI components needs review

## Technical Debt

1. **UI Inconsistency**: Different UI components have different approaches to state management
2. **Documentation Gaps**: Some components lack proper documentation
3. **Test Coverage**: Some components have limited test coverage
4. **Legacy Code**: Some areas still contain legacy approaches

## Next Focus Areas

1. Audit all UI components for proper event usage
2. Update documentation to reflect the current architecture
3. Enhance test coverage for critical components
4. Review performance of data processing operations
