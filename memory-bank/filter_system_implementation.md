# Filter System Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully implemented an enhanced filtering system for the Chest Tracker Correction Tool. The implementation includes:

1. Filter classes (TextFilter, ValidationListFilter, DateFilter)
2. Filter manager for coordinating multiple filters
3. UI components for filter interaction
4. Filter adapter for connecting to the data store
5. Filter state persistence

## Changes Made

### Core Components

- **TextFilter**: Enhanced to support regex, case-sensitivity, and whole word matching
- **ValidationListFilter**: Added multi-select capabilities, inclusion/exclusion, and list handling
- **DateFilter**: Created new date range filter with start/end date support
- **FilterManager**: Improved to handle multiple filter types and state persistence

### UI Components

- **FilterPanel**: Updated to support different filter types and maintain filter state
- **FilterSearchBar**: Enhanced with advanced search options
- **FilterDropdown**: Added multi-select capabilities and better display
- **FilterDateRange**: Created new date range selection widget

### Integration

- **FilterAdapter**: Enhanced to:
  - Auto-detect and register common filters
  - Support configuration persistence
  - Handle special column types (lists, validation errors)
  - Update filter values when data changes
  - Save and load filter state

- **DashboardInterface**: Updated to:
  - Initialize filter adapter with config manager
  - Connect signals for filter state changes
  - Save and restore filter state
  - Update UI based on filter status

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/filtering_system.md`
- Updated README.md with new filtering features
- Created test script `scripts/filter_test.py` to demonstrate filter usage

## Testing

The new filtering system was tested with:
- Unit tests for filter classes
- Test script to demonstrate functionality
- Manual UI testing

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements include:
- Filter combinations (AND/OR logic between filters)
- Saved filter presets
- Filter history
- Additional filter types (numeric range, boolean)
