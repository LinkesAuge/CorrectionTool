## Recent Context (March 19, 2025)

### Drag-Drop Functionality Fixes

We have successfully fixed critical bugs in the drag-drop functionality that were preventing the application from starting correctly. The issues were related to adapter implementations for ValidationListWidget and CorrectionRulesTable components:

1. **Fixed Widget Access Patterns**:
   - Updated `ValidationListDragDropAdapter` to use the correct `_table_view` attribute instead of a non-existent `list_view`.
   - Modified `CorrectionRulesDragDropAdapter` to use the `CorrectionRulesTable` widget directly since it inherits from QTableView.

2. **Corrected Event Handling**:
   - Fixed incorrect Qt event type references in both adapters.
   - Updated event handlers to use `QEvent.DragEnter`, `QEvent.DragMove`, and `QEvent.Drop`.
   - Added explicit QEvent import to ensure compatibility.

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Enhanced `drag_drop_functionality.md` with implementation details and compatibility notes.
   - Added a section to `bugfixing.mdc` to document the issues and their resolution.

These fixes have ensured that the drag-drop functionality works correctly, allowing users to drag items from validation lists to the correction rules table to quickly create new rules. The application now starts without critical errors related to these components.

### Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Develop automated tests for drag-drop adapters.
   - Verify drag-drop functionality across different data scenarios.

2. **Enhancement Opportunities**:
   - Implement drag-drop between validation lists.
   - Add multi-item drag-drop support.
   - Improve visual feedback during drag operations.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create user guides for drag-drop functionality.
   - Add developer documentation for extending the drag-drop system.

## Current Focus: Implementing and Testing Drag-Drop Functionality

The application is now more streamlined and follows a consistent architectural pattern, which will facilitate future development and maintenance.

## Current Task
Completing the Interface Documentation and Visualization phase

## Current Context

We have successfully completed the comprehensive documentation and visualization of the interface system for the Chest Tracker Correction Tool. This includes creating:

1. **Visual Diagrams**:
   - Class diagrams for core interfaces and UI adapters
   - Sequence diagrams for key workflows (import, validation, correction)
   - Component diagram showing application structure
   - Dependency injection diagram showing service creation and injection
   - Event system diagram showing publisher-subscriber pattern implementation

2. **Tools for Diagram Management**:
   - Validation script to ensure diagrams stay in sync with code
   - Generation script for creating PNG/SVG files from PlantUML diagrams

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated interface_documentation.md with comprehensive usage examples

   - Updated memory-bank/progress.md with the latest project status

## Next Steps

We are now ready to begin implementing the Validation List Management Enhancement phase, which will include:

1. Updating the validation service to support multiple validation lists
2. Adding search functionality to validation lists
3. Supporting import/export of validation lists from CSV
4. Adding duplicate detection for validation entries
5. Implementing bulk editing of validation lists

## Current Implementation Plan

The implementation plan consists of four main phases:

1. ✅ **Interface Documentation and Visualization** (COMPLETED)
   - Create class diagrams for core and UI interfaces
   - Create sequence diagrams for key workflows
   - Create component diagram showing application structure
   - Create dependency injection diagram
   - Create event system diagram

2. **Validation List Management Enhancement** (NEXT)
   - Update validation service to support multiple lists
   - Add search functionality to validation lists
   - Support CSV import/export for validation lists
   - Add duplicate detection and bulk editing

3. **Configuration UI Development**

   - Implement user preference profiles
   - Add visual configuration for validation strictness

4. **Transaction History and Visual Feedback**
   - Add transaction support for operations
   - Implement undo/redo functionality
   - Create visual indicators for correction applications

## Architecture Summary

The application is built around a set of core interfaces:

- **IDataStore**: Responsible for data management and persistence
- **IFileService**: Handles file operations (import/export)
- **ICorrectionService**: Manages correction rules and their application
- **IValidationService**: Manages validation lists and entry validation
- **IConfigManager**: Handles application configuration
- **IServiceFactory**: Provides access to service implementations

The UI components use adapter interfaces to interact with the underlying UI framework:

- **IUiAdapter**: Base interface for UI adapters
- **ITableAdapter**: Handles table data display and interaction
- **IComboBoxAdapter**: Manages dropdown/combobox components
- **IStatusAdapter**: Updates status messages and indicators

Components communicate through the event system using the publisher-subscriber pattern:

1. Components register handlers for specific event types
2. Publishers trigger events without knowing the subscribers
3. The EventManager dispatches events to all registered handlers

Dependencies are managed through the ServiceFactory:

1. The AppBootstrapper initializes the application by registering services
2. Services are registered by their interface types
3. Components request services through the factory rather than creating instances directly
4. The ServiceFactory resolves dependencies automatically through injection

## Current Focus

As we move to the next phase, our focus will be on enhancing the Validation List Management system to make it more flexible, user-friendly, and powerful. This will include adding search capabilities, import/export functionality, duplicate detection, and bulk editing features.
