- **Configuration Centralization**: Path management consolidated in ConfigManager

### Technical Implementation Decisions
- **Event System Standardization**: Consolidating EventType to a single implementation in interfaces/events.py
- **Singleton Removal**: Eliminating singleton pattern in favor of consistent dependency injection
- **Fuzzy Matching Approach**: Using fuzzywuzzy with Levenshtein distance for fuzzy string matching
- **Validation Levels**: Three levels of validation strictness: Exact, Case-Insensitive, and Fuzzy
- **Correction Priority**: Correction rules applied in priority order based on rule type and specificity
- **File Format Preservation**: Original file structure preserved during export

## Current Code Health

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: ~75% of core functionality
- **Documentation**: Docstrings present for most public interfaces
- **Type Hints**: Applied to most functions and method signatures
- **Code Style**: Following PEP 8 conventions with ruff for linting

### Known Issues
- Event system inconsistency causing event propagation issues
- UI components with inconsistent dependency access patterns
- Configuration migration lacks comprehensive error handling
- Large file processing can cause UI freezes due to synchronous operations
- Fuzzy matching threshold needs further tuning for optimal results

### Technical Debt Areas

## Recent Context (March 19, 2025)

### Drag-Drop Functionality Fixes

We have successfully fixed critical bugs in the drag-drop functionality that were preventing the application from starting correctly. The issues were related to adapter implementations for ValidationListWidget and CorrectionRulesTable components:

1. **Fixed Widget Access Patterns**:
   - Updated `ValidationListDragDropAdapter` to use the correct `_table_view` attribute instead of a non-existent `list_view`.
   - Modified `CorrectionRulesDragDropAdapter` to use the `CorrectionRulesTable` widget directly since it inherits from QTableView.

2. **Corrected Event Handling**:
   - Fixed incorrect Qt event type references in both adapters.
   - Updated event handlers to use `QEvent.DragEnter`, `QEvent.DragMove`, and `QEvent.Drop`.
   - Added explicit QEvent import to ensure compatibility.

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Enhanced `drag_drop_functionality.md` with implementation details and compatibility notes.
   - Added a section to `bugfixing.mdc` to document the issues and their resolution.

These fixes have ensured that the drag-drop functionality works correctly, allowing users to drag items from validation lists to the correction rules table to quickly create new rules. The application now starts without critical errors related to these components.

### Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Develop automated tests for drag-drop adapters.
   - Verify drag-drop functionality across different data scenarios.

2. **Enhancement Opportunities**:
   - Implement drag-drop between validation lists.
   - Add multi-item drag-drop support.
   - Improve visual feedback during drag operations.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create user guides for drag-drop functionality.
   - Add developer documentation for extending the drag-drop system.
