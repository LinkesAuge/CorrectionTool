## Current Progress

### Completed
- ✅ Defined core interfaces:
  - `IDataStore` - Interface for the data store
  - `IFileService` - Interface for file operations
  - `ICorrectionService` - Interface for correction operations
  - `IValidationService` - Interface for validation operations
  - `IConfigManager` - Interface for configuration management
  - `IServiceFactory` - Interface for the service factory
  - `IUiAdapter`, `ITableAdapter`, `IComboBoxAdapter` - Interfaces for UI adapters
- ✅ Created implementations for these interfaces
- ✅ Created a demo script showing how to use the interfaces
- ✅ Implemented Protocol-based interfaces to avoid metaclass conflicts
- ✅ Resolved circular dependencies by using lazy loading in package __init__.py files
- ✅ Created an AppBootstrapper class to handle initialization of services
- ✅ Updated UI adapters to implement Protocol interfaces
- ✅ Created a script to verify no circular dependencies remain
- ✅ Updated ServiceFactory to support Type-based service registration and resolution
- ✅ Created test script to verify bootstrapper initialization

### In Progress
- 🔄 Updating services to use interfaces for dependency injection
- 🔄 Implementing more UI adapters for all UI components

### Pending
- ⏳ Creating a service locator for runtime resolution of dependencies
- ⏳ Updating the main application to use the new architecture
- ⏳ Creating comprehensive tests for all interface implementations
- ⏳ Creating user documentation for the new architecture
